# Policy Guardian — Release Notes v1.0.1 (Docs Polish)

This is a docs-only follow-up to v1.0.0.

Changes:
- Clarified the frozen spec to reflect v1.0 release while keeping schema version v0.1
- Removed emoji numbering and tightened compliance wording
- Updated SECURITY.md with explicit non-identity statement and clarified what signatures prove
- Cleaned README duplication and minor wording inconsistencies

No code changes. No schema changes.
